        <hr>
        <h3> This website and the service available through it is owned by ChoiceGenie (“ChoiceGenie”).  At ChoiceGenie, we respect your privacy, and we understand the importance of the information you entrust to us.  This Privacy Policy describes our practices concerning the treatment of information we collect from you when you visit our website and utilize the services we offer.</h3>
        <h3>By visiting this website or using our service, you consent to our collection and use of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Therefore, we strongly suggest that you read it, and to contact us if you have any questions.
        </h3>
        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          The information that we collect from you depends upon what sections of our website you visit and what actions you take during your visit.  We collect the following kinds of information:</p>
        <p> (a) General Information:  General Information consists of information that is anonymous in nature and does not identify you as an individual.  General Information of this nature is collected through “cookies”, “web beacons”, or other similar tracking technology and may include your computer IP address, unique mobile device identifier, browser type, ISP or carrier name, the URL of the last webpage you visited before visiting our website, and actions you undertake on our website whenever you visit. This information gives us insights on how our users use our website and our services.</p>
        <p> We also obtain clickstream data using these automated collection methods, which is a log of content on which you click while browsing. As you click through our website, a record of your actions may be collected and stored. Clickstream data also can tell us the type of computer and browsing software you use, the address of the website from which you linked to our website, and the pages you access on our website. Your clickstream data may allow us to narrow or limit the advertising materials provided to you based on your prior online activities or preferences.</p>
        <p>(b) Your Personally identifiable information (PII):  PII is information that personally identifies one individual from another.  You voluntarily provide us with this information when you register on our website or use our service. We may also collect PII about you from third-parties that provide us with such information at your request.  We may also collect information about you, from you or from third-parties, when third-parties, such as the Retail Electric Providers (“REPs”), contact us to request or verify information about you. </p>
        <p>The types of PII we may collect include:</p>
        <ul>
         <li>Your name, postal address, email address, and telephone number;</li>
         <li>Your Social Security number;</li>
         <li> Your financial institution payment information;</li>
         <li>Your credit history and score;</li>
         <li> Your employment status;</li>
         <li>Your account ID, energy usage history, and meter number;</li>
         <li>Account and credit details from the REP you select;</li>
         <li>Information about your home or business (i.e., square footage; heating system type, etc.);</li>
         <li>Your energy service plan preferences; and</li>
         <li> Such other elements of PII submitted by you on our website or provided to us by third-parties such as REPs.</li>
       </ul>
         <p> In addition, when you visit our website, we will record your computer IP address or mobile device number, and may tie it to your specific account. Under ordinary circumstances, an IP address or mobile device number recorded in isolation is not PII under the standard definition of the term.  However, it may become PII when it is combined with other information, as in this case.
        </p>
        <p>(c) User Submitted Content: Our website may offer interactive forums and other features that enable users to post content for review and comment by other users. If you post any content, you will be identified by your name, and any information you post, including any personal information, will be viewable by other users. The contents of your postings, and your linked profile, will be freely available to the public on the Internet.  For more information about such interactive forums and related functionality, please read our Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>We may also provide social media features on the website that enable you to share information from this website via social media sites.  Your use of these features may result in the collection or sharing of information about you by these sites and other third-parties. We encourage you to review the privacy policies and settings on the social media sites with which you interact to help you understand those sites’ privacy practices.</p>
            <p>If you log in to your ChoiceGenie account through social media platforms (such as Facebook), we may access and store information through an interface provided by the platform in accordance with the social media platforms’ policies.</p>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use your PII and other information to provide you with our service and to provide you with offers from third-parties such as REPs, or as otherwise directed by you.  We may also use your PII in the following ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
       <li>To facilitate your application for energy services from various REPs;</li>
          <li>To obtain your credit history and score;</li>
          <li>To verify documents;</li>
          <li>To create and manage your online accounts and profile;</li>
          <li>To send you email messages or postal mail about your account and other matters that we believe may be of interest to you, including offers for third-party products and services;</li>
        </ul>
       <p>For internal business purposes, such as market research, website analysis, etc.; and
         To comply with applicable legal requirements, protect our legal rights, and to enforce our Terms of Service
         We use the information we collect through cookies and your clickstream data to improve our website’s features, to customize your visits, to determine which of our website’s pages you access, to narrow or limit the advertising materials provided to you based on your prior online activities.</p>
        <p><b>Note that we may also choose to anonymize certain elements of the PII you provide to us so that it can no longer be attributed to you.  We will use PII that we render anonymous in the same manner as we use General Information.
        </b></p>

       <h2>How We Share Information</h2>
        <p>We may share the information described above that we collect from and about you with REPs, with our affiliates, with third-party service providers, and with our joint marketing partners.  We will not share any of your provided financial institution payment information with any third-party other than your selected REP.
        </p>
        <p>It is important to note that REPs are not affiliated with us, and handle their own customer service and billing, and may use your information in accordance with their own privacy policies, which we encourage you to review prior to using our service to facilitate your application for energy services with a REP. It is important to note that you are responsible for contacting the REP directly to review their privacy policy and that we do not host or maintain access to REP privacy policies.
        </p>
        <p>Should you decide to customize your results or account using your actual usage data, or if you request rate quotes for a business, we may access your usage data, meter number, and premise identification number through an automated interface maintained by your utility or other third-party and we may share this information with REPs.
        </p>
        <p>We may share PII with nonaffiliated third-parties that perform services or functions on our behalf, including, without limitation, cloud storage and web hosting providers, marketing service providers, email service providers, and software maintenance service providers. We must necessarily share your information with such third-parties as may be required to perform their functions.
          If requested or required by law enforcement authorities, courts, or regulators, we may disclose any information we have collected from you. We also may disclose your information to exercise or protect our legal rights or to defend against legal claims.</p>
        <p>In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these business transfers, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred.  Moreover, if all or substantially all of our business assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that we go out of business or enter into bankruptcy, customer information (including your PII), would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third-party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any assets may continue to be used as set forth in this policy.
        </p>

        <h2>How We Protect Information</h2>
        <p>We take the security of your information seriously and use appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect PII against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage.  Our website and the server(s) upon which it is hosted use Secure Socket Layering (SSL) to encrypt information including user login and password, user account content, credit card numbers, etc.  This website uses a generally accepted standard of technological security for the purpose of protecting PII provided by visitors from misuse, loss, or corruption. We also limit access to PII to those employees and contractors who reasonably need access to it to deliver our service.
        </p>
        <p>However, because no security system can be 100% effective, we cannot and do not completely guarantee the security of any information we may have collected from or about you.  In addition, we have no control over the security of other web sites on the Internet that you might visit even when a link may appear to those websites. If you share your computer or use a computer that is accessed by the general public, remember to sign off and close your browser window when you have finished your session. If there is a breach of security, then we may either post a notice through the service or attempt to notify you via email so that you can take reasonable protective steps.
        </p>
        <h2>How Long We Keep Information</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to retain all the information you provide to us for as long as we deem necessary to fulfill a business purpose or comply with a legal request.  If you would like to object to our keeping your information, please follow the instructions in Section 6. 
        </p>
        <h2>Your Rights and Control</h2>
        <p>You may limit how we use your PII as follows:  (i) You may elect not to have cookies set by our website by configuring your browser; (ii)  You may withdraw any consent you previously provided to us, or object at any time to the processing of your personal information by following the contact instructions in Section 12 (note that this may prevent you from using certain elements of our service); (iii) You may stop receiving commercial emails from us by clicking the “unsubscribe” link at the bottom of the email (this will not prevent or interfere with us sending you non-marketing transactional communications); (iv) you may edit or delete some or all of your PII (apart from your name and contact information) at any time.  However, we reserve the right to anonymize certain of the information you provide to us so that it can no longer be attributed to you if we would like to retain it for longer periods of time. You may exercise Your Rights and Control by contacting us at the address listed in Section 12 or following instructions provided in communications we send to you.
        </p>
        <h2> Third-Party Links</h2>
        <p>Our website may include links to our business partners’ websites and links to other sites. If you choose to provide any information to any of these entities, the collection and disclosure of your information by that entity will be governed solely by that entity’s privacy policy. We make no representations or warranties regarding these sites. In addition, our website may include social media features and widgets, such as the Facebook “Like” button, the “Share This” button and other interactive mini-programs (collectively, the “Social Media Features”). The Social Media Features may collect Information such as your IP address and which page you are visiting, and may also set a cookie to enable the Social Media Feature to function properly. Social Media Features are either hosted by a third-party or hosted directly on our website.

        </p>

If you choose to use our service, we may require you to provide contact and identity information, billing information, shipping information and other personal information as indicated on the forms throughout ChoiceGenie. Where possible, we indicate which fields are required and which fields are optional.

We automatically track certain information about you based upon your behavior on our Site, Apps and our other technology platforms. We use this information to do internal research on our users' demographics, interests, and behavior to better understand, protect and serve you and our community. This information may include the URL that you just came from (whether this URL is on our Site or not), which URL you next go to (whether this URL is on our Site or not), your computer browser information, and your IP address. We use cookies on our Web site to check your preferences and to maintain session information, including identification of users and preparation of customized Web Pages. Web Browsers set aside a small amount of space on your hard drive to keep these preferences, and then every time you visit a Web site your browser checks to see if you have any predefined preferences (cookies) for that server. If you do, it sends the cookie to the server along with the request for a web page. Your browser will not give up its cookie data to any server except the one that set it. ChoiceGenie collects personal information when you register with ChoiceGenie, when you use ChoiceGenie services, when you visit ChoiceGenie pages or use ChoiceGenie Apps.

<p>
    We may use third parties that we refer to as internal service providers to facilitate or outsource one or more aspects of the business, product and service operations that we provide to you (e.g. couriers, mail, and bill collection) and therefore we may provide some of your personal information directly to these internal service providers.
