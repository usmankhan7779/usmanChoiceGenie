            <h2>Service Description</h2>
            <p>
              ChoiceGenie is an energy supplier comparison platform (“Service”) that enables users to compare and contrast the services and associated rates offered by participating third-party Retail Electricity Suppliers (“REPs”), and to sign up for service with a selected REP.   In addition, the Service offers information and guidance to assist users to select the Supplier that best meets their needs.</p>
        <p>Energy Plan information and ratings are intended only as general guidelines, and ChoiceGenie does not guarantee the accuracy of any such information or ratings. All Suppliers featured on this Site are independent third-parties.  ChoiceGenie does not guarantee that the energy service offers or terms and conditions made available by REPs are the best or lowest available in the market.  ChoiceGenie does not sell, resell or license any of the services offered by REPs, nor is ChoiceGenie acting as an agent of sale for REPs. ChoiceGenie disclaims any responsibility for, or liability related to, any service offered by participating REPs (see Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability, below). Any questions, complaints or claims related to any service should be directed to the appropriate REP.</p>
        <p> ChoiceGenie only displays the information that REPs provide in a manner that assists our users to choose among them, and is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the information we display. ChoiceGenie does not warrant that service descriptions, pricing, or any other content of the Site, regardless of its source, is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free.  Site content is provided for informational purposes only and does not constitute an endorsement by ChoiceGenie of any REP.  ChoiceGenie assumes no liability for inaccuracy or incompleteness in its search results, or other content on the Site.</p>
              <p>If you elect to establish service with a REP via our Site, you do so under the specific terms offered by such REP, so you must also agree to and understand those terms. Your interaction with any REP accessed through this Site is at your own risk and ChoiceGenie does not have any responsibility for the quality of the services you receive from any such REP.

          <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.</p>
        <h2> Limitation of Liability & Release.  </h2>
        <p>In no event shall ChoiceGenie be liable to you or any other party for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages, however and wherever arising, that may result from your use of the Site or the ChoiceGenie Service, including without limitation to losses incurred due to:</p>

        <p>ChoiceGenie is not responsible for examining or evaluating the business practices, action, omissions, or services of participating Suppliers.  If you elect to establish an account with a Supplier on this site, you should first carefully review the terms and conditions of that Supplier’s service.  IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND A SUPPLIER LISTED ON THE SITE, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, YOU RELEASE CHOICEGENIE, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AFFILIATES, OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, AND LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES FROM AND AGAINST CLAIMS AND DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, KNOWN AND UNKNOWN, SUSPECTED AND UNSUSPECTED, DISCLOSED AND UNDISCLOSED, ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY CONNECTED WITH SUCH A DISPUTE.</p>
        <p>If you are a California resident, by using the Site, you explicitly waive the rights granted to you under California Civil Code 1542, which states: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him must have materially affected his settlement with the debtor.”  If you are a New Jersey resident, certain sections of this TOS, including Sections 5, 6, and 7 may not apply to you pursuant to the New Jersey Truth in Consumer Contract, Warranty, and Notice Act.
